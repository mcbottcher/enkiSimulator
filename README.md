# Description
This project provides an additional ROS based package in the examples directory. This gives an example for using the enki simulator with the ROS framework used in [AI-Line-Follower](https://github.com/a2198699s/AI-Line-Follower).

# Use with ROS

First the enki library needs to be built:
```
cd enkiSimulator
cd enki
qmake
make
```

Then we want to build the ROS package
```
cd ..
cd examples/ros_example/catkin_ws
catkin_make
```
NOTE: you might have to empty the catkin_ws/devel and catkin_ws/build folders due to saved user specific cache stuff

To run:
source the workspace
```
source devel/setup.bash
```
and run with
```
rosrun enki_ros_pck robot
```

The robot will not move, but it can be tested using the line following package given by [AI-Line-Follower](https://github.com/a2198699s/AI-Line-Follower/tree/master/ros_packages)
